# Hungary-moves-forward
Most stuff is self-explanatory but I am going to give a quick rundown of everything here.
  However, if you're interested in how this project came to be you can read the XYZ file where I explain the idea and history behind it, and other things in detail.

  the module to run, the heart of the operations
