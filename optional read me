This project started out because I was pissed at the Hungarian government's data base, so I said f*ck it I'm going to
    make a better one on my own, as a proof of concept that a functional data base regarding every information about
Hungarian citizen's could be made by (at the time) a 20 year old dude with pretty basic laptop, and a none existen budge.
So take that Viktor!

Originally everything was in the -proof_of_concept.py- file but a friend of mine suggested that I split it to 
different files to make it more efficient and readable.

names.py:
Here in Hungary people have 2 lists of first names to choose from when naming their new born one if the kid is going to 
be a boy and another if they going to be a girl (yeah, legally there are only 2 sexes here, no option to change yours
(as far as I know)). 

So I used those lists as a starting point for random names, sadly I couldn't find a decent list of surnames so I tried to
use all the surnames I could gather to generate "real people". 
That however is not remotely accurate, which comes form the fact that some surnames can be found more wildly than others such
as 'Nagy', 'Kovács' and 'Tóth', the 3 most 'popular' ones, with 242, 226 and 221 thousand people having a name starting with
(here in hungary surnames comes first than your first name(s)) one of these. 
There are a grand total of 10 million permanent resident in this country. My current planed solution is simple and 
inefficient, I just put 'Nagy' in the pool 242 000 times. Currently that pool has about 32 000 surnames in it,
that means there would be more 'Nagy' people than the entire current list, just the 8 most used names would be 1 and a 
half million entries, I repeat, JUST THE FIRST 8 MOST POPULAR SURNAMES WOULD RESULT IN MORE THAN
A MILLION LINES OF TEXT. So that's not really a long term option if I ever want a semi efficient program/database.
My current idea is to use dictonaries that contain how many times -XYZ- there are, the only problem is, I have no idea how to
make this.


Then via a quick Google search I found out that the oldest person in Hungary was born in 1910 and died in 2021
(or 2020 I'm not quite sure) so I used that that as one limit the other limit being the actual date, I might upgrade
this by adding 9 months to the actual date, so that there could be records of babies not yet born. I know that everyone
is against collecting data, but if we do it might as well do it properly, nevertheless this project isn't really about
collecting data, it's about simulating a functional data base with random details, but that since my major is security
engineering I'm going to try and make it as secure as possible, using some form of encryption.

At some point I'd like to move the database part to SQL or maybe PHP to make myself familiar with those as well,
